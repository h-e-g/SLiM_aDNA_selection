# SLiM_aDNA_selection
Forward-in-time computer simulations (SLiM) combined with 'abc' to assess selection at the SNP level using frequencies from aDNA data

# SLiM Script
Script written in Eidos (SLiM) language providing simulated per variant frequency trajectories as can be extracted from pseudo-haploid aDNA data in combination with modern diploid data.

# R script (abc)
Script performing the abc analysis post SLiM computer simulations and providing point and confidence interval estimations of the parameters of interest.
